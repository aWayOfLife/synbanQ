### Please Note: 
We have developed two separate applications. Since the apps are in beta stage, kindly don't close the app while testing the application to ensure a smooth functioning.</br>

1. Initially, add entries in the synQ app at a particular branch (say, Card Centre) and for a specific time slot(say, 12:00-13:00). Thereafter, one can login to the banQ app with the Banker's location as Card Centre and they would be able to viw the specific entries for a particular time slot( depending on the time when you have logged in).</br>

2. The banQ app is supposed to work only during banking hours (10:00 - 16:00). But for testing purpose if you are opening the banking app at any other time, please abide by the following rules:</br>
  i. If testing between 00:00 - 09:59 hrs then make bookings from synQ at the slot 10:00 - 12:00.</br>
  ii. If testing between 16:01 - 23:59 hrs then make bookings from synQ at the slot 10:00 - 12:00.</br>

In case of any concerns/issues that might arise while testing either of the applications , kindly refer to the Unit Case Document attached below or mail us at : saptarshide2013@gmail.com </br>

### Please Note: 
We have developed two separate applications. Since the apps are in beta stage, kindly don't close the app while testing the application to ensure a smooth functioning.</br>

The banQ app is supposed to work only during banking hours (10:00 - 16:00). But for testing purpose if you are opening the banking app at any other time, please abide by the following rules:</br>
1.If testing between 00:00 - 09:59 hrs then make bookings from synQ at the slot 10:00 - 12:00.</br>
2.If testing between 16:01 - 23:59 hrs then make bookings from synQ at the slot 10:00 - 12:00.</br>
